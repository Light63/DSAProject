# DSAProject on Students' Performance Prediction
Readme file section for my AI/ML Course project on Students' Performance Prediction 
### Project Overview
This project is about building a machine learning model to predict student performance. The model uses five key inputs: hours studied, previous scores, extracurricular activities, sleep hours, and number of practice questions. The goal is to help teachers and students understand what affects performance and support better learning decisions. A decision tree algorithm was used, and the results showed high accuracy in predicting student scores and grades.

### Problem Statement

Different students have unique, peculiar strengths, weaknesses, levels of assimilation, and study styles. Many students struggle to perform well on their final exams, and it can be hard for teachers to know which students need extra help. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict a student’s final exam score by using data such as their study time, sleep hours, past grades, etc. By making early predictions, schools and teachers can better support students and improve their overall performance.
